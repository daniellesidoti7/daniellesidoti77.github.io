<h1>Kitty The Cat</h1>
	<body> <p> This page is going to contain information about my
tux suit cat. My kitty is a recuse from an alligator farm in Alabama where he would have risked losing his life.
From seeing the situation that this poor little kitten was in being without a mother or other kittens with him
my sister Brittany took it upon herself to take this helpless kitty in and give him home. After bringing him to our
home in a small town in Massachusetts that is just 30 minutes north of boston is when the real test of this 
nugget would take place. This country side kitty didn't quite know what he was going to be handling once he
got back to the cold temperatures of Massachusetts with all different animals to surround him that he once saw
in his first months of life. When my sister did end up recusing him he was younger then what people usually 
would begin taking them from mothers, but seeing kitty's mother wasn't in the picture the situation was different
because he was four weeks old and already away from his mother when he should have had another four weeks with her.
Now that you have some back story of this country side kitten named Lucifer I can now take you through the journey we 
experienced when they arrived home that day.</p>
