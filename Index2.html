<h><b>The Strange Doings of Kitty</b></h>
<p>As kitty grew close to us throughout the first couple months, he was adventurous and liked
to climb on us and explore us. Kitty didn't fully into loving us until about three months ago, 
but that was because of the fact that he couldn't actually explore until I left for college and
put my loving guinea pig on adoption. After that our cat had the ability to roam throughout any
room of the house and make it his own. With the extra freedom that he had just contained he felt 
as if he was finally apart us, wondering throughout the rooms and sleeping with whom ever is more
comfortable and warm. Although somethings my kitty would rather be alone and sleep without anyone
laying a finger on him, or he could be the most loving little cuddle buddy who comes underneath 
the covers and purrs on you while you sleep. Other times, you could be simply walking around the 
house looking for him and he will just pop out of nowhere and start attacking you. </P>
